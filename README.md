# Pattern-Preserving Anonymization of Time-Series Data

This project implements the principles outlined in the papers ‘Supporting Pattern-Preserving Anonymization for Time-Series Data’ and ‘Utility-Based Anonymization for Privacy Preservation with Less Information Loss’. The primary objective is to anonymize time-series data while preserving the inherent patterns within the data.
